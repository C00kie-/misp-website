## The Social Perspective in Intelligence Activity Among Information Sharing Communities

## Introduction

## (1) Subject scope

Intelligence activity is a common practice shared among different fields. The practice of intelligence evolved to adapt to the evolution of human societies. The transition from analog to digital introduced changes in social practices and communications.

Transmission of information is a key element to intelligence activity, as such a subject of studies in anthropology and social sciences. The goal of this research is to understand and describe the practices of information exchange among intelligence communities, by analyzing their cultural aspects.

### (1.1) The interest in studying information sharing

Information sharing has become a key in our society’s effectiveness, as in facing information warfare.

Many studies and research in the field of information security and intelligence focused mainly on the practical, the standardization, the usage perspective and the technical aspects of information sharing, without an analysis of its social or cultural aspects.

### (1.2) Intelligence and information sharing in the age of online criminal activities, study of group and practices

Information sharing plays a key role in law enforcement investigations and especially to track and take-down criminal activities. Efficient information exchange ensures resolution and prosecution in a timely fashion. Information strongly relies on the existence of sharing communities among law enforcement and intelligence.

## (2) Problem statement

We lack some opportunities to make successful sharing among the community of research. In order to tackle this issue, we must first understand how information sharing happen.

### (2.1) State of the Art

An extensive review has been performed in the field of information sharing. A significant number of academic papers focused on the structure of information and especially the tools used. Most of the research focus on a niche in intelligence, such as building competitive analysis or structuring data exchange.

In the bibliography, we listed papers which are related to the information sharing platform MISP, which will allow us to meet and interview groups who are actively performing information sharing.


## (3) Research methodology

### (3.1) Research design

We assume that we can observe replicates of social practices from real to digital environment, and a specific set of practices on sharing platforms such as MISP ("people need to make sense out of it").

A series of interviews will be conducted among sharing communities. We are interested in the comparison between usages of the platform that we observe, in one hand, and what people can tell us about it, in the other hand.

We use both technical observations, as statistics from the platform, and qualitative observations from the interviews (discourse analysis).

As a starting point, we included a list of question related to information sharing addressed to participants "Example list".

We narrow our questioning about the following points:

- Common assumed (survey) reasons why organizations are not sharing.
- Common reasons why organizations are sharing.

In order to integrate as much data as possible and to avoid pre-interview categorization, we will perform free interviews.

#### Example list

Common reasons why organizations are not sharing (ref. Goldenberg, I., Soeters, J. and Dean, W.H. eds.,) as an example list:

- Lack of trust within the community
- Cultural reason (language)
- Cultural reason (geopolitical)
- Pride (my information is so critical, so I don't share it)
- Shame on the information owned (cannot share because it's not interesting in their point-of-view)
- Don't see the benefit of sharing
- Not used to share information
- Don't share information in communities (only ad-hoc mode - email/phone/conf call)

Common reasons why organizations are sharing:

- Increasing cohesion (positive effect on the community)
- Create common approaches (such as: context, data model, predictability)
- Increase network and partnership (it increases trust)
- Cross-checking (creates a validation or counter analysis)


### (3.2) Data analysis model

- Collecting structured information from sharing platforms (e.g. MISP data to refine or use existing)
- Interviews (unstructured or semi-structured model) [^2]

Structured information from sharing platforms such as the type of information shared, the activity per organizations and the contextualization applied to the collection of information.
Partially structured information from the interviews. Different data analysis technics will be applied especially to cross-validate data from sharing platforms and the unstructured data collected from interviews.


### (3.3) Expected results and contribution

The research results will include the description of social practices which participate to information sharing.

Our goal is to discover, elaborate and test social models to qualify specific aspects.

- The distinction between producing and conveying [^1] organizations (producing and sharing participants can be different)
- The description of the context surrounding the production and sharing of an information
- The description of sharing dynamics in sharing communities
- An exploration of factors to improve sharing

These qualifications can be then used to improve detection mechanisms within organizations.

### (4) Conclusion

The research results might be impacted by the following parameters:

- Risk of too much diversity (heterogeneous) in dataset
- Tampered/false information from the sharing communities
- Limited dataset (representativity) on specific sharing communities
- Potential strong deviation from standards
- Inability to collect data due to the confidentiality level of specific sharing communities

# Project (3) Secure Distributed-Learning on Threat Intelligence - EPFL and armasuisse Science and Technology, Lausanne

Collaboration in the Framework of C4DT between armasuisse Science and Technology and the Laboratory for Data Security of EPFL.

Cyber security information is extremely sensitive and confidential. This introduces an information-sharing trade-off, between the benefits of improved threat-response capabilities and the drawbacks of disclosing national-security-related information to foreign agencies or institutions. The purpose of this project is to resolve the aforementioned trade-off by enabling secure collaborations with valuable sensitive data that is not normally shared. Each institution keeps full control over their data records, that never leave their security perimeter, whereas computations are protected by efficient and highly-scalable multiparty-homomorphic-encryption techniques. This will expand the range of available intelligence, thus leading to new and better threat analyses and predictions.
