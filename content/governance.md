# MISP Model of Governance

MISP project is a large open source project with the goal to make viable tools and format to improve information sharing at large.
In order to achieve our goals, the MISP project gathers feature requests, feedback and bug reports from different sources. As described in the graph below,
we have various sources that we use, including MISP user-groups, direct community feedback via GitHub, MISP trainings and the yearly MISP summit.

## Features and Roadmap

The features in the MISP project are built from practical use-cases in information security, intelligence communities, incident response teams and fraud analysis groups.
These groups provide their input via the different methods mentioned above. Some groups are actively taking part in developing the MISP project whilst many others contribute by
providing bug reports, feature requests or proposals to enhance the project. As the various communities have common goals, the MISP core team maintains the list
of features and prioritises the implementation based on the impact and usefulness in the different groups and communities.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your feedback or ideas to the MISP project, the most common approach is to open a GitHub issue describing your feature request or
feedback. Our model of contribution is open and [our code of conduct is available](https://www.github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/code_of_conduct.md) in the MISP core project.
