MISP Professional Services (MPS) is a program handled by the lead developers of MISP Project, in order to offer highly
skilled services around MISP and to support the sustainability of the MISP project.
This initiative is meant to address the policy requirements of companies/organisations requiring commercial support contracts.

In addition to the best-effort support available through the usual [support channels](/documentation/#community-support/),
our MISP Professional Services are meant to be used by companies and organisations who want to make sure their issues are
fast-tracked and are prioritised.

The following MISP Professional Services are available:

## Trainings

The MISP Project team is very experienced in both focused/targeted small group and broader large audience trainings,
either at our location or at a location specified by the organisation taking the training.
We are flexible on the content and can adapt it to the level of expertise of the participants if required.
Most of the time we are doing sessions lasting 1 to 3 days, with an incremental approach when it comes to the required technical experience each day.
The training is always held by two of our MISP core team members.

The MISP team frequently gives open trainings within their premises in Luxembourg and sometimes abroad.
A list of the current trainings can be found at the [events page](/events/).

There are different custom training offerings:

a) For on-site closed trainings up to 30-50 attendees (depending on conditions of the location):
We charge EUR 3656,18 per training day plus additional expenses ([see below](#additional-costs-for-all-missions-outside-luxembourg))

b) For closed trainings up to 30 attendees in Luxembourg:
We charge EUR 4266,05 per training day including food and beverages
