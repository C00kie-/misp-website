We are excited to announce the latest updates to MISP with versions **v2.5.3** and **v2.4.201**, which bring numerous enhancements, bug fixes, and security improvements to strengthen threat information sharing capabilities. As with any security release, we highly recommend that you update ASAP and inform your partners to do the same. 

## ðŸš€ **New Features**  

### **Improved Editor and Report Management**  
- **CodeMirror Editor Plugin**: Added a new `placeholder` plugin to display placeholders in the editor interface.  
- **Instance-Wide Report Variables**: Introduced instance-wide template variables for reports.

  - All users can now utilize and view these variables.  
### **Protected event improvements**
  - Exchanging of protected events via feeds is now supported
  - Uploading protected events via the import MISP JSON functionality is now supported

- Improved UI messages for file alias management, error handling, and general clarity in the Event report's "Imported Picture" page.

### **Sync and Server Improvements**  
- Added UI and API export to display bound synchronization users in `/users` and `/servers` views.  
- Updated Redis serializer to default to JSON.
