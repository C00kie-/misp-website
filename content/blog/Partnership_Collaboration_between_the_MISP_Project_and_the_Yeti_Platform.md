The [MISP Project](https://www.misp-project.org/), renowned for its threat intelligence sharing platform, and [Yeti Platform](https://yeti-platform.io/), the Forensics Intelligence platform supporting CTI and DFIR practitioners, are coming together to create a more robust and interconnected open source landscape.

At the heart of this partnership is the belief that open source software, driven by a community rather than commercial entities, is essential for fostering innovation, transparency, and security in the cyber domain. By collaborating, MISP and Yeti reinforce the ethos that collective effort and knowledge sharing are key to tackling the complex challenges of cybersecurity.

Leveraging Standards for Enhanced Interoperability This collaboration will capitalize on the existing [MISP standard format](https://www.misp-standard.org/) and [STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression)](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=c6c33da0-d1ee-42dd-9427-018dc7d32277) OASIS, ensuring a seamless exchange of information and interoperability between different platforms. The alignment with these well-established standards exemplifies the commitment to a unified approach in threat intelligence sharing. For instance, the projects will leverage and reuse the [misp-stix library](https://www.github.com/misp/misp-stix) to facilitate structured exchanges between the various tools.

Looking forward, the partnership is not only about enhancing current capabilities but also about laying the groundwork for future collaborative efforts. Both the MISP Project and Yeti Platform are open to engaging with other initiatives, aiming to continuously improve and evolve their open source projects. This open-ended collaboration model promises ongoing enhancements, adaptability, and resilience in the face of evolving cyber threats.

In an age where cybersecurity threats are ever-present and evolving, the collaboration between MISP Project and Yeti Platform is a testament to the power of open source communities. Together, we stand stronger in the face of cyber threats, committed to a safer digital world through shared knowledge and collaboration.
