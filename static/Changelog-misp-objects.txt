* Add: [network-connection] Added MAC address attributes. [Christian Studer]

* Add: [registry-key-value] New template to describe registry key values. [Christian Studer]

  - The `registry-key` object template includes
    already the `data`, `data-type` & `name` fields
    of a registry key value, but there is a
    limitation in the case of multiple registry key
    values
  - In order to describe multiple registry key
    values, instead of adding a simple `multiple`
    field to the related and above mentioned fields,
    it is better to use the `registry-key-value`
    template so we know which data, data type and
    name values are related to a given registry key
    value
  - It is then possible to have a reference between
    the registry key object and the related values

* Merge branch 'Vasileios-Mavroeidis-patch-4' into main. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* Update definition.json. [Vasileios Mavroeidis]

  Found the issue and updated the playbook-id attribute. It is not required anymore. We should not dictate producers generating this property since it can be used to correlate playbooks. The use case is: If we have a cacao playbook attached then we could have the UUIDV4 extracted from the "attachment" and put at the MISP security-playbook object attribute "playbook-id". Correlation is enabled if another security playbook object follows the same process while attaching the same CACAO playbook. If the attached playbook is a png then there is no way to associate it again with another security playbook object that has the same png as an attachment as we cannot know that. That would be possible only if the attachment had a machine-readable identifier. Another use case is to generate a hash and attach it to a property, but let's leave that for the future and if it is never needed or appears as a use case. Long story short the pull request improves the semantics of the object and correlations of different security playbook objects :)


## v2.4.160 (2022-08-04)

### New

* [sigma] a sigma attribute exists in MISP but the object was missing to add some additional meta information. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* [query] query object to describe search queries on SIEM and other tools. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  MISP object template designed following requests and especially this twitter thread:

  https://twitter.com/castello_johnny/status/1540610057263628289

  I added a list of sane default based on the ones I have seen being used:

        "sane_default": [
          "event query language (eql)",
          "keyword query language (kql)",
          "Query DSL",
          "Query (Elastic Search)",
          "Sigma",
          "Lucene query",
          "Google search query",
          "Ariel Query Language (qradar)",
          "Grep",
          "Devo LINQ"
        ],

  Thanks to Gianni Castaldi and others for ideas.

  The object can be expanded and improved over the time and the needs
  to share new queries.

  - we might revise this in the future if it causes issues, however, then we should also restrict the use of multiple IP addresses

* Chg: [network-connection] add a counter following discussion with @chrisr3d. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* Merge branch 'aaronkaplan-patch-1' into main. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* Update definition.json. [AaronK]

  Added time_first_ms, time_last_ms. Clarified a few things in the descriptions.

* As discussed with @rafiot, we can't simply add rdata and rrname as text only into MISP objects. Why? Because otherwise we can't use MISP's correlation engine to correlate attributes (rrname, rdata) inside these MISP objects with other events. Because "text" would not correlate with other "ip-src" or "domain" types in other objects/attributes. [aaronkaplan]

  Kind of sucks to duplicate the rrname and rdata entries, but that's the
  only solution we came up with.

  The COF2MISP module will populate both the rrname,rdata as well as the
  rrname_{domain,ip} and rdata_{domain,ip} attributes.

  Checked with jq_all_the_things.sh.
  Thanks for your consideration.

  Creation of Network Profile MISP Object

* Creation of Network Profile MISP Object. [Carlos Borges]

  The idea behind this object is to provide a unique form to identify network artifacts.
  It's a mix of different including whois, URL and domain.

  The need for a consolidated object comes to group correlated elements.

  Beyond that, I'm introducing the idea to use the correlation feature in more generic ways.
  Example:

  The value of "threat-actor-infrastructure-value" is the unique value observed on a network resource that identify it. A practical and tested example is this resources from Kaspesky.

  https://securelist.com/the-tetrade-brazilian-banking-malware/97779/

  On this article they mention a trojan family called Javali. They recover the C2 server abusing Google Docs services. The mentioned field "threat-actor-infrastructure-value" would register the values available on this image. This item should be hard to correlate with other similar items, as this can change frequently.

  A way to change it is also to register a more general pattern of the data with the "threat-actor-infrastructure-pattern". I.E

  inicio{
  "host":"<variable>",
  "porta":"<variable>"
  }fim

  With other investigations and registry of it on MISP, is possible to correlate this data, facilitate identification of patterns used for tracking purposes and facilitate analysis.

  Additional objects could be created like report, transactions and like
  to fully support AML.

  The existing person in MISP objects was previously updated to include
  the field missing from AML.

  A potential evolution is based on the transaction status which can
  be described as a simple relationship between MISP objects like:
