  - changes in sectors,
  - adding subsectors with detailed description,
  - adding taxonomies for important entities
  - adding subsectors for important entities.
  Work done as part of contribution to EnCaViBS project https://encavibs.uni.lu
  [machinetag2.txt](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/files/8948834/machinetag2.txt)

  Contribution from @AMEXTT

### Changes

* [MANIFEST] updated. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* [tlp] updating the new version of the traffic light protocol published by FIRST.org. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Some notes concerning the version 2.0 of the tlp taxonomy:

  - A new tag is introduced `TLP:AMBER+STRICT` to clarify the restriction to
  share only with your organisation.
  - A new tag is introduced called `TLP:CLEAR` which seems to replace
  `TLP:WHITE` as it disappears from the version 2.0 of the official TLP
  document.
  - The old tag `TLP:WHITE` is preserved in the taxonomy. As we don't have
  any official reference in the version 2.0 about the compatibility with
  `TLP:CLEAR`, we *assume* it's a synomym from the original `TLP:WHITE`.
  - The old tag `TLP:EX:CHR` is also preserved in the taxonomy for
  backward compatibility.

  We strongly recommend any users using the tlp taxonomy in their tools to review
  workflows and ensure that the new version 2.0 is taken into consideration.

  A new predicate has been added to potentially influence IDS flag at
  event or attribute level. This is often a desired option to overwrite
  existing IDS flag set by the event creator by a local preference.

  - `misp:ids="true"` -> set the IDS flag
  - `misp:ids="force"` -> force the use of the ids predicate (over the IDS flag set)
  - `misp:ids="false"` -> unset the IDS flag

  This predicates is not currently used in MISP directly but must be
  used for external tools using it. Those tags can be set at local or
  global level depending of the use-case.

  Updated Taxonomy for Sectors and Digital Services based on the EU NIS Directive. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#ntr17-L_2016194EN.01000101-E0017

  Removed entity types that have been misclassified as sub-sectors. If we wanted to include entity types we should have done the same for all subsectors and not selectively for the sectors that do not define subsectors. If this is something that we desire, instead of removing what I have suggested we need to include all the ones that haven't initially.

  Second, the digital service providers in the NIS Directive should not be classified as sectors but as digital services. Normally this would require a new taxonomy of three entities only. I can go both ways.

* Add: [type] Taxonomy to describe different types of intelligence gathering discipline which can be described the origin of intelligence. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  This taxonomy has been created for various reasons:

   - For the past years, we have seen a recurring tag called "type:osint"
     actively used by various sharing communities.
   - The Intelligence Community is actively using the information
     gathering classification.

  So we basically merged in the type namespace which has the advantage
  to keep the old free tag "type:osint" valid and get a more consistent approach
  for the overall classification used in information gathering in IC.

* Add: priority-level added in MANIFEST. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  After an incident is scored, it is assigned a priority level. The six levels listed below are aligned with NCCIC, DHS, and the CISS to help provide a common lexicon when discussing incidents. This priority assignment drives NCCIC urgency, pre-approved incident response offerings, reporting requirements, and recommendations for leadership escalation. Generally, incident priority distribution should follow a similar pattern to the graph below. Based on https://www.us-cert.gov/NCCIC-Cyber-Incident-Scoring-System.

  TLP and fr-classif updated with exclusive property.

  The exclusive property can be used by the software (e.g. MISP) to warn users
  if (s)he tries to add multiple tags on the same element (attribute, event...).
  It's up to the configuration of the software to enforce it or not.

  By default, tags are not exclusive.

* Machinetag list is now sorted by default. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* A first version of A series of assessment predicates describing the analyst capabilities to perform analysis or making judgments under a certain level of uncertainty. These assessment can be assigned by the analyst him/herself or by another party evaluating the analyst or the analysis. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  This is based on various documents but especially those two documents:

  - Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (Richards J. Heuer, Jr.)
  - Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases (Amos Tversky; Daniel Kahneman)

  The challenge when doing such taxonomy is to describes a human process
  into a machine-readable taxonomy. So feedback (via PR or issues)
  is more than welcome.

  The Targeted Threat Index is a metric for assigning an overall threat

  computer. The TTI metric was first introduced at SecTor 2013 by Seth
  Hardy as part of the talk “RATastrophe: Monitoring a Malware Menagerie”
  along with Katie Kleemola and Greg Wiseman.

* New mapping taxonomy library added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  A simple JSON format where a vernacular/common name describes
  all the potential associated machine tags.

  The format is a simple JSON object with a key for the common name
  which references a list of potential associated machine tags.

  The usage (in a first step) in MISP will be the following:

  - The replacement in the index UI of the corresponding list of machine
    tags by the vernacular/common name.

  - The ability to add automatically associated machine tags when tagging with the
    vernacular/common name.

  Even if the machine tags is not enabled in MISP, the tag will be added.

  The objective is to generate all the public indexes of MISP taxonomies

  updates of taxonomies from MISP or any other application.

  Note for taxonomy maintainer, don't forget to PR for the MANIFEST
  update.

  To be included in the MANIFEST are the external references too (as
  a ref array in each taxonomy).
