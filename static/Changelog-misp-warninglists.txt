  VPN list is outdated

* VPN list is outdated. [Loïc Jaquemet]

  github.com/ejrv/VPNs/ has not been refreshed in 24 months.
  https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn/ seems to have replicated that effort for ipv4. No new source found for ipv6
  Pros:
  - Code for generation is in repository

  Cons:
  - Unsure about quality. Lots of ASN as source of data.
  - No IPV6 data

  Comparable open source sources:
  - Firehol https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets / datacenter.ipset . Source data (https://github.com/client9/ipcat) is outdated from 2019
  - https://github.com/jhassine/server-ip-addresses limited provider list
  - https://incolumitas.com/pages/Datacenter-IP-API/ API, smaller list

  Others sources seem commercial (Udger, securitytrails)
